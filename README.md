<p align="left">This is the first App I’ve built during my year at the Academy! It was meant to be a travel guide for all the people that are afraid to miss events, museums, nightlife, typical food in the places they visit. It was realised only for Naples due the short amount of time, the city we all lived in when the App was developed. The design was pretty basic as we aimed to perfectly follow the Human Interface Guidelines. Noah had an experience of gamification, you could basically add event to your favourites just by scrolling in the main views, but even shuffling by events in a random way.</p>
